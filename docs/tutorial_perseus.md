### Importing results into Perseus

Reports generated by FragPipe can be used with a variety of tools for exploratory analysis, differential quantification, and visualization.
For Windows users, [Perseus](http://coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:start) can be used to perform such tasks on FragPipe tables from label-free or isobaric labeling-based quantification.
This page has instructions for loading a ‘combined_protein.tsv’ table into Perseus.



#### Open Perseus
Download and unzip the file from the [download page](http://coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:common:download_and_installation), then launch by double clicking 'Perseus.exe'. When the program launches, open the matrix upload dialogue by clicking the green arrow icon on the Matrix tab.

#### Load FragPipe results
Use the 'Select' button to find the 'combined_protein.tsv' file from FragPipe. Column names will be listed in the left panel. Select the columns containing the intensities you want to explore or compare and use the '>' to move them over to the 'Main' section. (For this example, there are a total of six samples from two different experimental conditions, so we load the six '[sample] Razor Intensity' columns.)

Relevant labels (e.g. protein ID and gene name) should be moved to the 'Text' section. When the columns of interest have been categorized, click 'OK'.

#### Explore the data
Once the matrix is loaded, intensity transformation, row annotation, filtering, hypothesis testing, plotting, and other analyses can be performed. See the [Perseus site](http://coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:start) for more details.
